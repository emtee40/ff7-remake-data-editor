  "$tk_comon_1120_0030_chd_0": "Together, you can cleanse the world of the Shinra scourge.",
  "$tk_comon_1130_0010_chd_0": "Now that was a battle!",
  "$tk_comon_1130_0015_chd_0": "What an impressive feat to hold your own against one of the most exalted summons known to man.",
  "$tk_comon_1130_0020_chd_0": "Together with the legendary Bahamut, I have every confidence you can expunge Shinra from existence.",
  "$tk_comon_1180_0010_chd_0": "Such bravery... Incredible!",
  "$tk_comon_1200_0010_chd_0": "Extraordinary!",

  "$tk_comon_2100_0060_chd_0": "The entirety of my research and your data has been uploaded into it.",
  "$tk_comon_2100_0070_chd_0": "If you possess the strength to defeat this weapon, then I know we will have what it takes to one day destroy Shinra.",
  "$tk_comon_2100_0100_chd_0": "And I...I will be free of Hojo at last. So...Cloud... I'm counting on you.",
  "$tk_comon_2200_0010_chd_0": "Well done, Cloud.",
  "$tk_comon_2200_0020_chd_0": "You've managed to fully tap into the potential once locked within you.",
